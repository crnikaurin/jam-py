==================
Creating a project
==================

Create a new directory. 

Go into the directory and run from command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ jam-project.py


The following files and subdirectories will be created in the directory::

    admin.sqlite
    css/
    index.html
    js/
    __pycache__/
    reports/
    server.py*
    static/
    tmp
    wsgi.py


To start the Jam.py web server run the **server.py** script.


.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py
     * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)


By default, the port is 8080. 

.. note::
    You can specify a different port as an argument, for example 
    
    .. code-block:: console
    
        $ ./server.py 8081
	 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8081/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        
    If you do specify a different port, you will need to use it in your browser in the succeeding steps.


Open a Web browser and go to “/builder.html” on your local domain – e.g., 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html. You should see the select language dialog. 

In this dialog, press the 'folder' button, which will show a list of languages.  Select one of the languages and press OK.

In the New project dialog box fill in:

* **Caption** - the project name that appears to users
* **Name** - name of project (task) that will be used in programming code to 
  get access to the task object. Should be a short valid python identifier.
  This name is used as a prefix when creating a table in the project database.
* **DB type** — select database type. If database is not Sqlite, it must be 
  created in advance and its attributes should be entered in the 
  corresponding form fields. 
  To see examples of Database setup, follow the :doc:`link </admin/project/database>`.

When you press OK, the connection to the database will be checked, and in case 
of failure 	an error message will be displayed.

.. note::

    Please note the following requirements:
    
    * to use **FireBird** database, the python ``fdb`` library must be installed 
    * **PostgreSQL** requires ``psycopg2`` library 
    * **MySQL** requires ``MySQLdb`` library
    * **Oracle** requires ``cx_Oracle`` library     
    * **MSSQL** requires ``pymssql`` library
    * to generate reports **LibreOffice** must be installed
    
.. note::

    For **SQLite** database, when an item field is deleted or renamed, or foreign 
    key is created, 
    :doc:`Application builder </admin/index>`,
    creates a new table and copies records from the old one into it.
    
    For **SQLite** database, Jam.py doesn’t support importing of metadata into an 
    existing project (project with tables in the database). 
    You can only import metadata into a new project.

If all goes well, a new project will be created and the project tree will appear 
in the Application builder.

Now, to see the project itself, create a new page in the browser and type in the 
address bar:

.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080
